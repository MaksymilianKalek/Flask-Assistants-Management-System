# Assistants Management System

This is a simple CRUD Flask application that I've created for one of the recruitment processes that I was a part of which allows you to:
- Create assistants
- Update their informations
- Delete them

## Installation

You need the following modules to run this app:

```bash
Flask
```
```bash
Flask SQLAlchemy
```
```bash
Pillow
```
```bash

```
```bash
Flask-Migrate
```

You can install these modules via:

```bash
pip install
```

## Usage

```
To seed the database:

```
